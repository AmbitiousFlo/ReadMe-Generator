## Challenges 

I ran into a huge issue when I finished answering all the questions, My README did not update properly. I needed to relink the file on line 96 to the appropriate file and the bug was fixed. I am glad I ran into this bug because I will not make that mistake again.


## Motivation 

My motivation for this project was to really learn node.js while building this project, I feel I have a better understanding of how to write a high quality readme generator. I will be using this generator in the future and may change a few things to fit my style of README.
